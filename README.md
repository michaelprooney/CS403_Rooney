# In Between the Sheets

## Game implemented by Mike Rooney

## Rules

In Between the Sheets is a turn-based game which you can play with any number of players. 

### Materials required:
- A standard deck of 52 playing cards
- Chips to represent monetary value ***could also use cash**

Each player playing the game will enter into the *pot* with a minimum bet decided on before the beginning of the game. In most cases, this minimum bet is equal to the amount of the lowest value chip on the table. After everyone has payed their ante, the dealer will deal two cards next to one another with enough space for a card to be dealt between them. At this time, the player to the left of the dealer will begin and has a set of options:
1. If the two cards are of the same rank, the player will forfeit the minimum bet to the pot and lose his turn.
2. If the two cards are a rank apart, no card exists which lands between them, so the player loses their turn.
3. Assuming the two cards are not equal, the player has the choice to either bet and see the third card dealt or to pass on their turn.
4. If the first card is an ace, the player must choose high (rank above a king) or low (rank below a two) prior to the second card being dealt. If the second card is an ace it is ALWAYS high, so if the player chose high when the first ace was dealt then he will default to number 1 above. 

### Betting, *Hitting the Post*, and ***SHOOTING THE MOON***

In the section above, the potential options facing the player are outlined. Assuming the player does not fall into the first or second category, they can either choose to bet or to pass on their turn. 

1. If they pass on their turn it will then go to the player on their left and two new cards will be dealt.
2. If they choose to bet, they are allowed to bet anywhere from the minimum bet (the ante) up to the contents of the *pot*.

Now assume they have bet, they are now in danger of what is called *hitting the post*. Think of the exclusive range between the two cards as two field goal post which the player is trying to make it in between. So, if you *hit the post* this means your third card is equal to one of the bounds of the given exclusive range. If the third card dealt is equal to one of the first two cards then that player now owes the *pot* twice the amount of money that they bet. 

**Special Cases**: 
1. *The Triple Screw*: When the two outer cards are a low ace and a high ace, if the third card dealt is an ace as well, then that player now owes three times their bet to the *pot*.
2. *Shooting the Moon*: If the two outer cards are two ranks apart, meaning only one card can possibly win them money, then the player is given the option to *shoot the moon* which means they can bet the minimum bet and if that one card pops up then they win the entire pot. 

Each time the *pot* is emptied, the players all must pay their ante again to continue playing. 

### How to Win

The object of this game is to win as much money as possible. With that in mind, there is no defined winning point so it all depends on the relative amounts of money once the game is concluded.

## How to Finish Playing

The game can go on until the players all agree to stop. If there is still money in the *pot* when the game is concluded then the money will be evenly divided between all the players of the game.
